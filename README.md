# ProgrammingGames_3DPlatformer


Player movement
- Player movement uses CharacterController
- Steering through the air is purposefully included (though in-air steering speed is reduced significantly)
- Added timer for how long player has not touch the ground. This was used so that the character doesnâ€™t start spazzing out if he leaves the floor for too little of a duration (it would look buggy otherwise)
- Player has 3 animations: idle, running, and jumping

Obstacle course
- Goal: reach the final orange platform
- Requires strafing (steering through the air) to get over one of the wooden boards. you need to jump outwards then steer back in.
- The little platforms at the end look hard but is surprisingly easy because you can steer in the air

Campfire
- When Player steps onto campfires, the player catches on fire
- When the player is on fire, the player loses all control for 4 seconds
- Player model will run in a random direction while jumping around

Enemies
- Enemies use a NavMesh to follow player. I intentionally set the obstacle course as not-walkable
- When players collide with the enemy, the player is kicked in the opposite direction
- Enemies have 3 animations: idle, running, flip(kick)
- I only have one enemy active, but feel free to add more (there is a prefab of the enemy in the prefabs folder)
